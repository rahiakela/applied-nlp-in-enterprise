        "One of the most important ideas to implement if you want to get deep learning working in the real world is transfer learning, which is the process of taking a model that has already been trained on another dataset and fine-tuning it to fit your new dataset. For example, if you're training a language model to generate compelling short stories in the style of Hemingway, you could fine-tune a model trained on a wide variety of books instead of training on just the text samples of Hemingway, of which there may not be many.\n",
        "\n",
        "A nice analogy in object-oriented programming is the concept of inheritance in classes.\n",
        "\n",
        "By training on the larger dataset, the model essentially inherits a large amount of extra knowledge, which it can use to perform better on the task you care about. From a practical standpoint, transfer learning helps you get better performing models faster since fine-tuning, if done correctly, is often computationally cheaper than training from scratch.\n",
        "\n",
        ">Assuming that the original dataset you're transferring *from* is much larger than the dataset you're using for fine-tuning. If your fine-tuning dataset is larger, perhaps you should be applying transfer learning the other way around! But in practice, it's very hard to natural language text datasets that are of comparable size to the ones used for pretraining.\n",
        "\n",
        "The other big advancement we'll discuss is the use of a new kind of model architecture called the transformer. Training transformers can be complicated and does not always work well without some fine-tuning. So, instead of traning it from scratch, we'll show you the pretraining technique on another architecure, and the use a popular pre-trained transformer to perform inference."
